Polaris: the first safety-focused Large Language Model (LLM) constellation for real-time patient-AI healthcare conversations.

We train these agents to have natural conversations that mimic what human caregivers would say, rather than a mere question-answering system as in prior works. For instance, the agent must be able to answer any question the patients may have, address their concerns, and otherwise handle tangential discussions in the conversation.

Furthermore, we design our system to build trust and rapport with patients, learning about their personality and preferences to demonstrate good bedside manner and leading to higher patient satisfaction and potentially better health outcomes.

Additionally, we conduct a challenging task-based evaluation of the individual specialist support agents.
